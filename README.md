## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get your custom launcher up and running, all you need is a simple `games.json` file in the same directory as the executable. This is where you'll define all your games and their associated media.

---

## ðŸ“„ The `games.json` File

This file acts as the database for your launcher. The application reads from it to populate the game list and display the correct information.

Here is a sample `games.json` file to get you started:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "Lies of P",
    "Description": "Lies of P is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Round8 Studio and published by Neowiz.",
